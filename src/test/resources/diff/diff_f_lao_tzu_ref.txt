- The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
- The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
  The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
- The Named is the mother of all things.
+ The named is the mother of all things.
+ 
  Therefore let there always be non-being,
    so we may see their subtlety,
  And let there always be being,
    so we may see their outcome.
  The two are the same,
  But after they are produced,
    they have different names.
+ They both may be called deep and profound.
+ Deeper and more profound,
+ The door of all subtleties!
